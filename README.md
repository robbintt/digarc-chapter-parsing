### This is a demo of some logic that can be used to parse chapters in text files.

##### Problem Statement:  

It is difficult to seek in a text file when using a screen reader.

How can we parse the chapters and sections into separate files for better reference?

For more information, please read the comments in the Python file.



##### Future

This piece of logic can be expanded into a more appropriate application framework for finding and chopping chapters and sections of text files.

How can we generalize the seek concepts beyond chapters to sections?  What about arbitrary index building? This is well within the capabilities of Python and could be used to chop and feed files into a screen reader on the fly. 

Are there Python screen reader API libraries?
